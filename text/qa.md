# Frequently Asked Questions and Answers


**Q1. How to organize my own phenotype data?**

&emsp;&emsp;A: Now the input data **MUST** be `.txt` format. I highly recommended first download the example of the expected input phenotype dataset from <a href="http://10.75.29.207/lab_pub_file/file/sample_phenotype.txt" target="_blank">**here**</a>, and then replace the phenotype values with you own data.


**Q2. Can I choose other models (GLM, MLM, CMLM, etc.) to run GWAS?**

&emsp;&emsp;A: NO, this app can only run the **EMMAX** model. It is easy to implement other models for GWAS, but other models need more time to run.

**Q3. Can I run the  GWAS of quality trait?**

&emsp;&emsp;A: Yes! quantitative trait and quality trait are fully support.

**Q4. How to choose the distance up/down-stream for gene extraction?**

&emsp;&emsp;A: This dependents on your **GWAS** results and Linkage Disequilibria of your sample. Here we recommend `75kb~100kb`.
